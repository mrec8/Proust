                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

Up a Tree
You are about 10 feet above the ground nestled among some large branches.  The nearest branch above you is above your reach.
On the branch is a small birds nest.
In the bird's nest is a large egg encrusted with precious jewels, apparently scavenged somewhere by a childless songbird.  The egg is covered with fine gold inlay, and ornamented in lapis lazuli and mother-of-pearl.  Unlike most eggs, this one is hinged and has a delicate looking clasp holding it closed.  The egg appears extremely fragile.

This is a large forest, with trees obstructing all views except to the east, where a small clearing may be seen through the trees.

Canyon View
You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south wall.  From here there is a marvelous view of the Canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs still appear to loom far above.  Following the Canyon upstream (north and northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO commands (most systems).

You are on a small, rocky beach on the continuation of the Frigid River past the Falls.  The beach is narrow due to the presence of the White Cliffs.  The river canyon opens here and sunlight shines in from above. A rainbow crosses over the falls to the west and a narrow path continues to the southeast.

                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

Canyon Bottom
You are beneath the walls of the river canyon which may be climbable here.  There is a small stream here, which is the lesser part of the runoff of Aragain Falls. To the north is a narrow path.

You are on a ledge about halfway up the wall of the river canyon. You can see from here that the main flow from Aragain Falls twists along a passage which it is impossible to enter.  Below you is the canyon bottom.  Above you is more cliff, which still appears climbable.

You are at the top of the Great Canyon on its south wall.  From here there is a marvelous view of the Canyon and parts of the Frigid River upstream.  Across the canyon, the walls of the White Cliffs still appear to loom far above.  Following the Canyon upstream (north and northwest), Aragain Falls may be seen, complete with rainbow. Fortunately, my vision is better than average and I can discern the top of the Flood Control Dam #3 far to the distant north.  To the west and south can be seen an immense forest, stretching for miles around.  It is possible to climb down into the canyon from here.

                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

                          WELCOME TO ZORK

    ZORK is a game of adventure, danger, and low cunning.  In it you will explore some of the most amazing territory ever seen by mortal man.  Hardened adventurers have run screaming from the terrors contained within!

    In ZORK the intrepid explorer delves into the forgotten secrets of a lost labyrinth deep in the bowels of the earth, searching for vast treasures long hidden from prying eyes, treasures guarded by fearsome monsters and diabolical traps!

    No PDP-10 should be without one!

    ZORK was created at the MIT Laboratory for Computer Science, by Tim Anderson, Marc Blank, Bruce Daniels, and Dave Lebling.  It was inspired by the ADVENTURE game of Crowther and Woods, and the long tradition of fantasy and science fiction adventure.  ZORK was originally written in MDL (alias MUDDLE).  The current version was translated from MDL into Inform by Ethan Dicks <erd@infinet.com>.

    On-line information may be available using the HELP and INFO commands (most systems).
